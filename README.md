# IcePoint Engine
Not a revolution in the world of game engines, not a fundamentally new solution. Just a good tool for developers of visual novels, allowing you to create really high-quality games in the shortest possible time.  
In development.

The release of version 0.0.1-alpha is scheduled for July, 2019.

Originally, this project was created to help people who want to create visual novels, but who can't program.
